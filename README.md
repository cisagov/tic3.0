# Trusted Internet Connections

## Purpose
The purpose of the Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) initiative, as outlined in the [Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memorandum M-19-26: Update to the Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/M-19-26.pdf), is to enhance network and perimeter security across the Federal Government. Initially, this was done through the consolidation of external connections and the deployment of common tools at these access points. While this prior work has been invaluable in securing federal networks and information, the program must adapt to modern architectures and frameworks for government information technology (IT) resource utilization. Accordingly, OMB’s memorandum provides an enhanced approach for implementing the TIC initiative that provides agencies with increased flexibility to use modern security capabilities. OMB’s memorandum also establishes a process for ensuring the TIC initiative is agile and responsive to advancements in technology and rapidly evolving threats.

[OMB Memorandum M-19-26](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/M-19-26.pdf) tasks the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) with modernizing the TIC initiative to help accelerate the adoption of cloud, mobile, and other emerging technologies. To further this effort, [CISA is releasing draft guidance](https://www.cisa.gov/trusted-internet-connections) to assist federal civilian agencies in their transition to contemporary architectures and services.

The updated draft TIC guidance provides agencies with the flexibility to secure distinctive computing scenarios in accordance with their unique risk tolerance levels. Agencies are expected to reference the initiative’s Program Guidebook, Reference Architecture, and Security Capabilities Handbook to determine how to protect their environments to conform with their risk management strategy and the security considerations outlined in TIC Use Cases.

**The official request for comments (RFC) period is currently closed.** CISA is adjudicating the comments from the RFC period, webinars, and roadshows in January 2020 and plans to release the final guidance documents in Summer 2020.
