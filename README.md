# Trusted Internet Connections

## Purpose
The purpose of the Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) initiative, as outlined in the [Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Memorandum M-19-26: Update to the Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) Initiative](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/M-19-26.pdf), is to enhance network and perimeter security across the Federal Government. Initially, this was done through the consolidation of external connections and the deployment of common tools at these access points. While this prior work has been invaluable in securing federal networks and information, the program must adapt to modern architectures and frameworks for government information technology (IT) resource utilization. Accordingly, OMB’s memorandum provides an enhanced approach for implementing the TIC initiative that provides agencies with increased flexibility to use modern security capabilities. OMB’s memorandum also establishes a process for ensuring the TIC initiative is agile and responsive to advancements in technology and rapidly evolving threats.

## Request for Comments
[OMB Memorandum M-19-26](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/M-19-26.pdf) tasks the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) with modernizing the TIC initiative to help accelerate the adoption of cloud, mobile, and other emerging technologies. To further this effort, [CISA is releasing draft guidance](https://www.cisa.gov/trusted-internet-connections) to assist federal civilian agencies in their transition to contemporary architectures and services.

The updated draft TIC guidance provides agencies with the flexibility to secure distinctive computing scenarios in accordance with their unique risk tolerance levels. Agencies are expected to reference the initiative’s Program Guidebook, Reference Architecture, and Security Capabilities Handbook to determine how to protect their environments to conform with their risk management strategy and the security considerations outlined in TIC Use Cases.

## Key Questions
CISA is interested in gathering agency responses focused on the following key questions: 
1.	How does your agency expect to utilize the updated TIC guidance to modernize and secure its environments?
2.	How does your agency expect to adopt the TIC Use Cases?
3.	Does your agency have any suggestions for other use cases?
4.	Are there additional documents or artifacts that would be helpful to agencies when implementing the TIC guidance?
